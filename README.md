OVERVIEW
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
 The goal is to provide data driven insights to the stakeholders to inform safety improvements, risk assessment as well as fleet expansion decisions

 DATA UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS
#1.1# 
The dataset used is obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. From this data set, we aim to identify which aircraft types have the lowest fatality rates and risks in order to venture into this new business endeavour

#1.2#
As mentioned above, the data is from NTSB for the time period of 1962 to 2023 which encapsulates aviation accidents and incidents over the stipulated time frame. in this section, we will begin data cleaning which will then enable us in imputation of data.
NOW, WE WILL SHIFT OUR FOCUS TO THE RATE OF FATALITIES ,DAMAGES AND THE TYPES OF AIRCRAFTS INVOLVED TO GET A GOOD GRASP ON WHAT WE ARE WORKING WITH
#1.3#
here we will primarily focus on fatalities as well as accident date, damages and the type of aircrafts involved
#OPERATOR_FATALITIES
Here, we will begin filtering data further to get a clearer picture of what we are dealing with and hence plot data that will help in the new business venture
#1.4#
We then proceed to filter the data since it is a little messy and handle imputation for eda focused outputs for the stakeholders to grasp.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1.
promote the purchase and use of safer aircraft types like the dassault falcon series as well as the dornier 228 series which have exhibited lower fatality rates per accident in their service history i.e we have determined that safety varies by model.2.

Operational standards are crucial - maintenance of the aircrafts in the airline as well as pilot training protocols is important for overal safety.
3.

Ensure data driven management. as we have done imputation above, sharing of this kind of information acrosss the aviation community wiould really help in preventing accidents in the foreseable future. This entails sharing data with regulatory bodies , other airlines and manufacturers.
